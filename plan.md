# Portfolio Project Fix Plan

## Overview
Based on the README.md and current state of the project, this plan outlines steps to fix and improve the portfolio website with focus on creating a system with multiple theme branches as described in the readme. The theme directories (`minimalist/`, `visual/`, `interactive/`, `creative/`, `arcade/`) already exist.

## Phase 1: Immediate Fixes & Base Setup

### 1.1. Fix Core Structure Issues
- [x] Fix stylesheet linking issue (`styles.css` vs `style.css`)
- [x] Fix HTML structure (removed commented code, implemented proper structure)
- [x] Fix scroll progress bar functionality
- [x] Fix theme switcher implementation and ensure proper working of theme options
- [x] Fix script.js functions to match HTML elements
- [x] Ensure responsive design works on all devices

### 1.2. Content & Structure Organization
- [x] Organize portfolio sections (experience, projects, skills, education)
- [x] Add proper link to the most recent resume PDF
- [x] Set up proper base structure for sections
- [x] Enable proper theme color switching with visual feedback on the main page

## Phase 2: Theme Linking Setup

### 2.1. Theme Link Mechanism
- [x] Update theme switcher links in `index.html` to point to the respective directories (e.g., `/visual/`, `/interactive/`).
- [x] Decide on strategy for theme switching (full page reload vs. more complex SPA-like behavior - starting with reload).
- [x] Ensure basic placeholder `index.html` exists in each theme directory.

## Phase 3: Theme Development

### 3.1. Minimalist Theme Enhancement 
- [x] Base theme implementation complete.
- [x] Refactor CSS into smaller files (`css/` directory).
- [x] Refine JS for better structure and accessibility.
- [ ] Optimize for speed and performance (Further review needed).
- [ ] Add any further refinements based on review.

### 3.2. Visual Theme 
- [ ] Implement modern simple animation effects.
- [ ] Add scroll animations for visual appeal.
- [ ] Implement parallax effects based on landscape/nature.

### 3.3. Interactive Theme
- [ ] Add SVG animations on scroll.
- [ ] Create natural view parallax animations.
- [ ] Implement interactive elements responding to user actions (e.g., interactive name concept).

### 3.4. Creative Theme
- [ ] Implement Three.js effects.
- [ ] Create dynamic neon fill effects (`dynamic-neon-fill.html` as reference).
- [ ] Add cyberpunk color scheme.

### 3.5. Arcade Theme
- [ ] Create mock-up of game-like portfolio experience.
- [ ] Plan for simple interactions in arcade style.

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization & User Preferences

### 4.1. Code Optimization
- [ ] Minify CSS and JS for production deployment (per theme).
- [ ] Optimize image assets.
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for performance.
- [ ] Test for performance across devices and themes.

### 4.2. User Preference Implementation
- [x] Save and apply user's theme color preference (minimalist theme).
- [x] Implement dark/light mode detection.
- [ ] Consider cross-theme preference persistence if feasible.
- [ ] Ensure fast loading speed and smooth transitions.

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

### 5.1. Cross-browser Testing
- [ ] Test all themes across multiple browsers.
- [ ] Test on different devices.
- [ ] Fix any compatibility issues.

### 5.2. Deployment
- [ ] Set up proper deployment mechanism for GitHub Pages (main branch deployment).
- [ ] Ensure theme directory links work correctly on deployed site.
- [ ] Consider separate deployments or subdomains for theme branches if needed.

## Phase 6: Documentation

### 6.1. Write Documentation
- [x] Update README with proper instructions and structure.
- [x] Create overview.md with project documentation.
- [x] Document theme switching mechanism clearly.
- [x] Document CSS refactoring in overview.md.

## Tracking
After each completed phase/major step, update progress.md with achievements and next steps.
