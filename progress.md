## In Progress
- [ ] Phase 4: Performance Optimization & User Preferences

## Next Steps
1. Optimize performance:
    - Review image sizes (if any are added).
    - Consider lazy loading for images.
    - Plan for CSS/JS minification (manual or build step).
2. Test themes across different browsers and devices (Phase 5).
3. Set up deployment (Phase 5).
4. Update `overview.md` documentation (already done).

## Notes
- Core content is now consistent across themes.
- Visual theme parallax uses `background-attachment: fixed`, may need JS for perfect mobile smoothness.
- Creative theme Three.js integration is pending.
- Arcade/Interactive themes have placeholders for more advanced JS.
